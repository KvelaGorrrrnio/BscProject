%This chapter describes the implementation of the full feature set of RL and SRL. Furthermore, the design of the web based user interface will be discussed.
We have, as was the goal of the project, successfully implemented interpreters for the reversible programming languages RL and SRL. Furthermore, both implementations support program inversion and -translation. Finally, a web based user interface for the two languages has been designed.
