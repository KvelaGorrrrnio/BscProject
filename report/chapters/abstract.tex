  This thesis presents the fundamentals of \textit{reversible flowcharts}. Reversible flowcharts are intended to naturally represent the structure and control flow of reversible (imperative) programming languages in a simple computation model in the same way classical flowcharts do for conventional languages. Although reversible flowcharts are superficially similar to classical flowcharts, there are crucial differences: atomic steps are limited to locally invertible operations, and join points require explicit orhogonalizing conditional expression.
