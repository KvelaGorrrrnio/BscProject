\chapter{Implementation}

We have, as was the goal of the project, successfully implemented the interpreters for the reversible programming languages RL and SRL. Furthermore, both implementations support program inversion and -translation. Finally, a web based user interface for the two languages has been designed. We will in this chapter go through the implementation of these and discuss potential further improvements.

%First, we will go through the changes that we have made to the original languages proposed in \cite{REV}. We will then describe the three main modules of the interpreters: Common, RL and SRL.
