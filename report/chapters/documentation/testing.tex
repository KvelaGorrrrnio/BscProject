\subsection{Command-Line Interface}
\todo{CLI testing}\\

%% Usage
When located at the root of the project, tests for the interpreters/cli can be executed by \shcmd{$ make test}.
For only getting output relevant for testing, build all targets with \shcmd{\$ make} before running the tests.\\

%% Setup
The test-system is being build and executed by \shcmd{$ stack test}.
The test-system is written in Haskell and is located at \path{/src/test} in Lib.hs and Spec.hs, where Spec.hs is the entry point.
The test-system searches for .rl and .srl files in \path{/src/test/suite}.
For each script, every file with the script filename (including extension) prefixed and .out suffixed are listed.
The script file along with all its .out files is a single test suite.
Outfiles in a test-suite can have the formats described in Figure \ref{fig:test_suite_formats}.

    test.srl.invert.out         & \texttt{\$ srl.rl invert test.srl}\\\hline
    test.srl.translate.out      & \texttt{\$ srl.rl translate test.srl}\\\hline
    test.json.srl.out           & \texttt{\$ srl.rl test.srl {-}{-}json}\\\hline
    test.json.srl.log.out       & \texttt{\$ srl.rl test.srl {-}{-}log {-}{-}json}\\\hline
    test.json.srl.invert.out    & \texttt{\$ srl.rl invert test.srl {-}{-}json}\\\hline
    test.json.srl.translate.out & \texttt{\$ srl.rl translate test.srl {-}{-}json}\\\hline
