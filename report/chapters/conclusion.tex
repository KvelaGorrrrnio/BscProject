\chapter*{Conclusion}

We have implemented the interpreters and the program transformations, for the reversible flowchart-languages RL and SRL, based on the theory described in the paper \cite{REV}.
For interacting with the interpreters corresponding command-line and web interfaces have been implemented.

As our test suite indicates, the interpreters, with the full set of intended features implemented, behave as expected.

We have discussed plausible improvements to the project --- most notably optimising efficiency for the interpreters, for faster execution, and a new program transformation for optimising code, to remove or at least reduce the exponential growth in size upon translation between RL and SRL.

(Janus: \cite{JAN})

We have reached the goal of this project, by implementing functional interpreters with correct behaviour and interfaces for interacting with these.
