We have, as proposed in the paper \cite{REV}, implemented an interpreter for each of the reversible flowchart languages RL and SRL. We have described, and argued for, a series of changes to the proposed languages and followed through with these successfully. Furthermore, a program inverter and a program translator have been implemented for each language. Two interfaces, used to run the interpreters and perform program transformations, have been designed and implemented; a command-line interface and a web-based user interface. The behaviour of the implementation has been tested thoroughly, and the results have strongly indicated that the interpreters indeed work as intended.

Potential bottlenecks of the implementation have been identified and discussed; most notable are the representations of programs, the efficiency of the interpreters, and the growth in size of programs when being translated. Furthermore, we have proposed some ideas that could solve these problems if implemented. Further development is most certainly justified.

Thus, we find it safe to say that we have reached the goal of this project. % by implementing interpreters with correct behaviour and interfaces for interacting with these.
