## RL and SRL: An overview

RL and SRL are two reversible programming languages proposed in the paper *Fundamentals of reversible flowchart languages* by Yokoyama et al. RL is a low-level, assembler-style language with unstructured jumps. SRL is, as the name implies, a structured version of RL with control structures, i.e. loops and conditionals.

This interface provides an easy way to play around with RL and SRL. Other than simple execution of programs, the interface also supports inversion and translation of programs - where translation means translating from structured SRL to unstructured RL, or, as proven possible by the structured reversible program theorem, from unstructured RL to structured SRL.

## CLI

The web interface interacts with command-line interface that can be downloaded and built at [the github repo](https://github.com/KvelaGorrrrnio/BscProject).
For instructions on how to install and run see the [CLI section](./cli).
